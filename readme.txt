Now with support for Pinterest!  A social networking alternative developed around improved flexibility and power, focusing on usability and power over number of available bookmarking sites.  This is a Wordpress adaptation of our HTML and Javascript widget for raw HTML developers.

== Description ==

SafeMarking was born out of a need for a an alternative to social bookmarking widgets that track, store and share the sensitive information of users.  In a world of growing security conscious web users, having a visitor find out your website is tracking their sensitive financial information without their knowledge could be devistating for your traffic.  SafeMarking widgets and plugins do not track any information about your visitors.  Information is not passed to the SafeMarking.com servers for our use.

This plugin was created to serve the most basic WordPress users with no programming experience, as well as the seasoned theme crafting veterans.  

== Installation ==

Simply upload to your WordPress plugins direction, and activate from the Plugins page within the WordPress admin panel.

The plugin will automatically begin adding bookmarking icons to each post with the default settings, and using the default icons.  Use the control panel to manipulate the settings for the output.
